  This project is based from [The Odin Project's Curriculum(HTML/CSS Project)](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).
  It consists on cloning Google's home main page. In my case was the Argentinian version of the page, therefore it's in Spanish.

  When I started this project i'd already basic knowledge of **HTML, CSS and Git**. Nevertheless this project challenged me in some aspects and because of that learned a few things, including:
  
    1. Basic Markdown Syntax

    2. How to add a favicon to the title of the page

    3. What normalize and reset consists (CSS)

    4. How to properly position elements on the page using containers
    
    
  This project also helped to reinforce my knowledge on many topics like...

  **GIT**
   - Basic commands *(add, status, log, commit, push)*
   - Clone repositories. 
   - Deploy repository to the web with [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/)
   
   
 **HTML**
   - Usage of semantic elements ```<header> <main> <nav> <footer>```
   - Relative references
   - Basic elements ```<a> <img> <input> <div> <h1..h6>```
   
 **CSS**
   
   - Typography: font-size, font-family, font-weight, text-decoration
   - Positioning Content: margin, padding, flex, display, text-align, vertical-align
   - Backgrounds: width, height, background (gradient, image, size, repeat, position, color)
   - Also border properties... etc.
